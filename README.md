## Build

### Protocol Buffer Definitions

Make sure you have installed protocol buffers as described here: 
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial#compiling-your-protocol-buffers

Then run `make proto` to build the definitions from the `/proto` directory
(don't forget to extend the Makefile if you add new definitions).
